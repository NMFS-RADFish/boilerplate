# Main example

[Official Documentation](https://nmfs-radfish.github.io/radfish/)

This is an example that encapsulates several other features into a single fully built application. It is complex by design, so it may make more sense to start with a different example if you are just getting familiar with the RADFish ecosystem. This example may be removed in the future, as many of the necesary design patterns have been illustrated in the other examples more effectively and clearly.
